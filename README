Idea of this project is to write eclipse-plugins which aid faster development of java projects.

List of plugins:

Copy As SQL:
  -> Very oftern java code has reference to several sql's to fetch data from database. Most of the time time 
these sql's are complex and span multi-line. 

For example: a multiline sql stored in java would look like this

private static string test_sql = "select col, col2, col3" +
                                  "col4, col5, col6 " +
                                  " from table test_table";

If i have to test this sql in sqldeveloper or any tool, i cannot copy this sql directly since it has special characters + 
" which sql tools won't understand. A normal copy and paste of the sql would look like this.


private static string test_sql = "select col, col2, col3" +
                                  "col4, col5, col6 " +
                                  " from table test_table";


This plugin helps solve this problem, where if u select the following sql and copy it using copy as sql, it converts it into a format where it can be easily
pasted in any sql tool and directly execute the sql.

So selecting above sql and clicking on plugin would conver this into

-- test_sql
select col1,col2,col3
col4, col5, col6
from table test_table
;


Copy As Multiline string:

It does similar things as copy as sql, but won't format the string by adding a semicolon and title line for the selection.


Usage:

-> Select the sql using mouse or touch pad, right click on the selection and click on "Copy As Sql". This option is right 
   after the paste button

-> Executing a paste after first step should give u desired result


Installation:

-> Download the project from repository
-> go to UtilityCommands/plugins directory
-> Copy the jar and place it in eclipse_home/plugins directory of ur local eclipse insallation
-> Restart eclispe
